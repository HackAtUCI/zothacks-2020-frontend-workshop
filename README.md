# ZotHacks 2020 Front-end Repository

This is the project repository for the ZotHacks Front-end workshop materials. Across the repository there are several branches representing different stages of the process.

This project was created using the HackUCI React Template, which was bootstrapped off of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Relevant Available Scripts 

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This is the command you will use before deploying your project, there will be seperate workshop materials for this.
